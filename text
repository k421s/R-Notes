#Hw: Determine what the parameters 
#in red mean and write a paragraph 
#explaining them.

#red parameters:
#cex
#mai
#fig
#new

par(cex=0.7, mai=c(0.1,0.1,0.2,0.1))
Temperature <‐ airquality$Temp

parameters in red are graphical arguments within par() used to customize features of graphs. 

cex
  changes the level of magnification of plotting text and symbols relative to default = 1
  less than one reduces size, greater than one increases size 

Mai
  defines the margins in inches
  is a numerical vector of the form c(bottom, left, top, right)

fig
  gives the (NDC) coordinates of the figure region
  is a vector c(x1, x2, y1, y2)
  unlike s, starts a new plot 

new
  Determines if the frame is cleaned before drawing a high-level plotting command 
  logical, defualt = FALSE

cex = 0.7 smaller labels
mai = c(0.1,0.1,0.2,0.1)  0.1 & 0.2 inches
fig = c(0.1,0.7,0.3,0.9))  
new = true means doesn't redraw 

# Use ?locator to find all the values for
# this function and describe them in a
